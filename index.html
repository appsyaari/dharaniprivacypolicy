Thanks! I’ll update your original privacy policy by replacing the old app name with "Landsnap - Search Land Records" and enhancing it to ensure full compliance with current Google Play policies, including explicit disclosures on advertising ID usage and third-party data sharing.
I’ll share the updated version shortly.

<h1>Privacy Policy for Landsnap - Search Land Records</h1>
<p>I built the Landsnap - Search Land Records app as a free service. This Service is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
<p>This page is used to inform visitors about my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.</p>
<p>If you choose to use my Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible on the Landsnap - Search Land Records app or website, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>For a better experience, while using my Service, I may ask you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information. For example, if you use a location-based feature, I might request your device's location. Don't worry - any personal information you provide (like your location) stays on your device and is not collected by me. In fact, the app does not collect your location data unless you explicitly use a feature that requires it.</p>
<p>For advertising purposes and analytics, I use the Android Advertising ID (AAID) from your device. This is a unique, user-resettable identifier provided by Google Play Services. I may share the AAID with third-party ad networks (like Google AdMob) to provide you with personalized ads and better services. You can opt out of personalized ads by resetting your advertising ID or turning off ads personalization in your device’s settings.</p>
<p>The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

<h2>Log Data</h2>
<p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, if the app crashes or has an error, I collect data and information on your phone through third-party services (often called Log Data). This Log Data may include information such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when using my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from websites that you visit and stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
<p>This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You can choose to accept or refuse these cookies through your browser or device settings. If you refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
<li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
<li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
<li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to inform users that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. These third parties include Google Play Services, AdMob, Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, and Facebook.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>I value your trust in providing your personal information, so I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Landsnap - Search Land Records may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me, so I strongly advise you to review their Privacy Policies. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Landsnap - Search Land Records is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete this information from my servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take necessary actions.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
<p>This policy is effective as of May 3, 2025.</p>
